## GEOGW12_F21_Lab7

A lab for Professor Vena Chu's class "Maps and Spatial Reasoning" (GEOG W12) at UCSB in Fall 2021. I wrote a short list of favorite places in CSV format and then used a provided R script to generate a [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) widget showing those places on a map, along with short descriptions and images for each. The result is available [here](https://nhamovitz.github.io/GEOGW12_F21_Lab7/).
